# Diatonic Chord Trigger Plugin for Logic X Scripter Insert

> This started as a version that just did `R 1 3 5 R` voicings for diatonic major chords which I found on github, but I lost the original repo. Apologies â€” I would have forked this otherwise.

I've expanded it to add sevenths, support more scales, as well as voice things in a more pleasing way.
